# 101 Sample Queries

This project contains about 101 samples from each of these areas:

<pre>LINQ To Objects
LINQ To SQL
LINQ to DataSet
LINQ to Xml
</pre>

Run the project, and select the type of LINQ sample that you want to explore. Drill down into the options, and run each individual sample that interests you, as shown in Figure 1\. The output from the sample and the code included in the sample will be displayed in the interface of the application.

See the [Connectivity](../../ReadMe.html#Connectivity) note found in the main ReadMe if you are have trouble running the database samples.
